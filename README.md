This is a class project for the course Regression Analysis, where I, along with 3 more teammates have done Regression Analysis to create a predictive model to explain median value of homes in Boston.

**Note** : Median house values are used because they are more accurate as compared to mean values. Median values are not affected by outliers.

We have used **506 observations** and **13 predictors** (features) for prediction.

The predictors (**X values**) are:\
**X1** per capita crime rate by town     
**X2** proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.   
**X3** proportion of non-retail business acres per town  
**X4** Charles River dummy variable   
**X5** nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)   
**X6** average number of rooms per dwelling  
**X7** proportion of owner occupied units built prior to 1940   
**X8** weighted distances to five Boston employment centres  
**X9** index of accessibility to radial highways   
**X10** full-value property-tax rate per 10,000   
**X11** pupil-teacher ratio by town   
**X12** 1000(B âˆ’ 0.63)2 where B is the proportion of African Americans by town   
**X13** a numeric vector of percentage values of lower status population 

Model is divided in training dataset (model building dataset) and testing dataset.
