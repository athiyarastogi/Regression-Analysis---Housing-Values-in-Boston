This is a class project for the course Regression Analysis, where I, along with 3 more teammates have done Regression Analysis to predict the future value of houses in Boston based on median house values.

**Note** : Median house values are used because they are more accurate as compared to mean values. Median values are not affected by outliers.

We have used **506 observations** and **13 predictors**, also called features for prediction.

The predictors (**X values**) are:
1. per capita crime rate by town (x1)
2. proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. (x2)
3. proportion of non-retail business acres per town (x3)
4. Charles River dummy variable (x4)
5. nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million) (x5)
6. average number of rooms per dwelling (x6)
7. proportion of owner occupied units built prior to 1940 (x7)
8. weighted distances to five Boston employment centres (x8)
9. index of accessibility to radial highways (x9)
10. full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 (x10)
11. pupil-teacher ratio by town (x11)
12. 1000(B âˆ’ 0.63)2 where B is the proportion of African Americans by town (x12)
13. a numeric vector of percentage values of lower status population (x13).
